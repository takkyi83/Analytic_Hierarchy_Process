# MCDM concept: 
eg:  you want to buy a car, there are some car models you want to have a look (a set of alternatives). Each car model (alternative) performs differently on different standards/functions, which are called "attributes".
However.. criteria are often conflict with each other. Therefore, you need to prioritise the creteria and leverage trade-off.
Creteria have "incommensurability", eg: engine power range cannot be directly converted to price range, which increased the difficulty of decision making process

So firstly, we need to set decision goals, and then making decisions.
Differnet models MADM, MODM (decide a "design" of decision-making).. will end up with different result.
